The purpose of the program is to simulate the behaviour of a deterministic automaton.

It includes things such as:

1. Checking if the input file is written correctly (if each line corresponds to a regex written 
within the code)
2. Checking if the word is accepted or not by the automaton
3. Checking whether the automaton is deterministic or not

The output will show if the word is accepted or not by the automaton, and if the automaton is 
deterministic or not.

Feel free to use it and document it if you feel like doing so!
